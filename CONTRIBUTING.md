**Contributing**

- Make sure you're using the latest version of Velocity before reporting a bug.

- Unless you're reporting an obvious bug that can be immediately recreated by anyone, please **create a demo** with the minimum amount of code necessary to reproduce your bug. You can use this template, which already has Velocity and its UI pack included: http://jsfiddle.net/65xCP/4/.

- ~For a variety of reasons, I rarely merge pull requests. There is no need to make one; just explain your issue and I will take care of it. Thank you so much!~ Having forked the project, we are happy to consider pull requests, however please note that part of the reason the original authors did not accept pull requests was because the source on github is not the original source (https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/issues/632) so this is worth bearing in mind if considering making changes.

- Please skim the FAQ before asking questions: https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity/issues/47.

- @ydaniv provides moderation support for Velocity's GitHub issues.
